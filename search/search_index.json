The following command creates a new project\nfrom a template into the current directory. This template provides a sample customer management service.\n\n\nvulcain new customers-service\n\n\n\n\n\nThis template is fully operational, you can go to the code, and test it directly in local mode\nusing \nhttp://localhost:8080/api\n with curl or postman.\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\nVulcain templates are predefined to be used with \nvscode\n or \nwebstorm\n.\n\n\n\n\nTry some urls to see how \nvulcain\n works:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nurl (prefixed with localhost:8080)\n\n\nHttp Verb\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/api/_servicedescription\n\n\nGET\n\n\nShow service description (metadata)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/api/_servicedependencies\n\n\nGET\n\n\nShow service dependencies (metadata)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/api\n\n\nGET\n\n\nDisplay all customers (this is the default behavior)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/api/customer.all\n\n\nGET\n\n\nIdem\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/api/customer.create\n\n\nPOST\n\n\nCreate a customer (see below)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/api/customer.delete\n\n\nPOST\n\n\nDelete a customer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/api/customer.update\n\n\nPOST\n\n\nUpdate a customer\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to \nconcepts\n to see more infos on the vulcain protocol.\n\n\n\n\nNow we can publish this service in a local demo swarm cluster. From the project root folder type:\n\n\ndocker build -t customers-service:1.0 .\nvulcain run customers-service:1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\nyou can also use ./build.sh 1.0 to build the service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvulcain run\n initializes a swarm cluster if any, create a net-vulcain network and create a new docker service.\n\n\n\n\nThe service is now available with a new exposed port (30000 if this is the first service in your swarm cluster). This port is displayed when the \nvulcain run\n command ends.\n\n\nLet's try to create some customers using this new port using the \ncustomer.create\n action.\n\n\nE.g.\n\n\ncurl -XPOST localhost:30000/api/customer.create -d \n'{\"firstName\":\"Albert\", \"lastName\": \"Einstein\"}'\n -H \n'Content-Type: application/json'\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can list all customers with /api/customer.all (or just /api).\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\nBy default, data is stored in memory and will be lost if you restart the container.\n\n\n\n\nCreating the facade service\n\u00b6\n\n\nWe will now create a new facade service exposing a customer with an additional fullName property.\n\n\nCreate a new service facade-service. In a new folder, type:\n\n\nvulcain new facade-service\n\n\n\n\n\nThen open the project and remove the \nsrc/api/samples\n folder to start with a new clean project.\n\n\nThe first thing to do is to create a model. A model (or schema) describes data manipulated by the service. It offers many\ncapabilities:\n\n\n\n\nFor input data, it is used to check and validate argument values (raising a 400 bad request error if any errors)\n\n\nFor storing data, it can be used by the \ndefault\n provider to get some persistance information like key definition, uniqueness, collection name...\n\n\nFor metadata description, it is used to display information (with /api/_servicedescription) useful to code generation or other tools.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new file src/api/model.ts and copy/paste the following code:\n\n\nimport\n \n{\n \nProperty\n,\n \nModel\n \n}\n \nfrom\n \n\"vulcain-corejs\"\n;\n\n\n\n@Model\n()\n\n\nexport\n \nclass\n \nCustomerView\n \n{\n\n    \n@Property\n({\n \ntype\n:\n \n'\nstring\n'\n \n})\n\n    \nfullName\n:\n \nstring\n;\n\n    \n@Property\n({\n \ntype\n:\n \n'\nstring\n'\n \n})\n\n    \nfirstName\n:\n \nstring\n;\n\n    \n@Property\n({\n \ntype\n:\n \n'\nstring\n'\n \n})\n\n    \nlastName\n:\n \nstring\n;\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a very basic model, it has the properties of a customer with an additional fullName property.\nSince this model will be used for output response only, no validation is added.\n\n\nNow we will create an handler to query a customer view into a new file src/api/queryHandler.ts\n\n\nimport\n \n{\n \nQueryHandler\n,\n \nQuery\n,\n \nAbstractQueryHandler\n,\n \nCommand\n,\n \nServiceDependency\n,\n \nAbstractServiceCommand\n,\n \nIHasFallbackCommand\n \n}\n \nfrom\n \n\"vulcain-corejs\"\n;\n\n\nimport\n \n{\n \nCustomersService\n,\n \nCustomer\n \n}\n \nfrom\n \n\"./customersService10\"\n;\n\n\n\n@QueryHandler\n({\n \nscope\n:\n \n'?'\n \n})\n\n\nexport\n \nclass\n \nMyQueryHandler\n \nextends\n \nAbstractQueryHandler\n \n{\n\n\n    \n@Query\n({\n \ndescription\n:\n \n\"Get a list of customers\"\n,\n \noutputSchema\n:\n \n'\nCustomerView\n'\n \n})\n\n    \nasync\n \nCustomerViews\n()\n \n{\n\n        \nlet\n \ncustomersService\n \n=\n \nnew\n \nCustomersService\n(\nthis\n.\nrequestContext\n);\n\n        \nlet\n \ncustomers\n \n=\n \nawait\n \ncustomersService\n.\ngetAllCustomer\n();\n\n        \nreturn\n \ncustomers\n.\nmap\n(\nc\n \n=>\n \n{\n\n            \nreturn\n \n{\n\n                \nfirstName\n:\n \nc\n.\nfirstName\n,\n\n                \nlastName\n:\n \nc\n.\nlastName\n,\n\n                \nfullName\n:\n \nc\n.\nfirstName\n \n+\n \n' '\n \n+\n \nc\n.\nlastName\n\n            \n};\n\n        \n});\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\nFor the moment, the editor displays errors. This is normal. We will see below how to remove the reference error on 'customersService10'\n\n\n\n\nHandler anatomy\n\u00b6\n\n\n\n\nAn handler is just a class with annoted methods. These annotations describe how the handler can be requested. There are 3 kinds of handler: \nQuery handler\n, \nAction handler\n and \nEvent handler\n. See \nconcepts\n\n\nThe \nQueryHandler\n annotation tells that the class exposes handler(s) for query (accessible with a GET http verb) and can define default configurations. In this case, the handler could be requested by any (anonymous) user thanks to the \nscope:'?'\n property.\n\n\nThe \nQuery\n annotation is used to expose a method. Annotations have mandatory properties used to describe the service. The query will be accessible from \n/api/customersview\n (The name is inferred from the method name removing).\n\n\nThe handler code is like any traditional method with some specificities:\n\n\nIt can take only one argument described by a model. This model will be validated before the method is called and can raise a Bad Request error in case of errors.\n\n\nThe return value must be described by a model (can be the same as the input argument). This is used to describe the service.\n\n\nIf any error occurs during processing the handler, a 500 http error will be sent to the client.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow it's time to remove errors from your code.\nYou can note that the service uses a custom service class (\nCustomersService\n) to read all customers. This is a proxy class requesting our first service : customers-service.\n\n\nBut how can i create this proxy class ?\n\n\nCommunication between services\n\u00b6\n\n\nThanks to the metadata description of any vulcain service, we can use dedicated tooling to generate code. Code generation uses template to generate a static class with typed method sending request that are high tolerance, monitored and vulcain compatible.\n\n\nVulcain compatible means context propagation : security context, global correlation id, tenant information...\n\n\nTo generate the proxy class, we need some information:\n\n\n\n\nAddress of the target service. In our case, localhost:30000\n\n\nA template to use, by default this is microServiceProxy (for generating vulcain proxy). The other template available is angularServiceProxy to generate proxy class for angular application.\n\n\nThe folder where the generated file will be saved. Default is the current folder.\n\n\n\n\nTo generate the class, type the following code from the application root folder (Change the port number if necessary)\n\n\nvulcain generate localhost:30000 --folder src/api\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proxy class encapsulates all requests into \nhystrix commands\n providing circuit breaker, timeout, bulkhead and monitoring.\n\n\nNow you can compile and test the service locally with:\n\n\ncurl http://localhost:8080/api/customerviews\n\n\n\n\n\nResult depends of how many customers you created before, but note the standardized response format.\n\n\nMonitoring command request with hystrix dashboard\n\u00b6\n\n\nTo enable hystrix monitoring, just set the variable \nenableHystrixStream\n to \ntrue\n in startup.ts.\n\n\nTo visualize metrics, we need to start hystrix dashboard with the following command:\n\n\ndocker service create --network net-vulcain -p \n9999\n:9002 --name hystrix-dashboard mlabouardy/hystrix-dashboard:latest\n\n\n\n\n\nThen open the dashboard on \nhttp://localhost:9999/hyxtrix\n, set the service endpoint with \nhttp://<host ip>:8080/hystrix.stream\n and click on \nMonitor Stream\n.\n\n\nYou can test monitoring by calling many requests.\nFor example with :\n\n\nab -n \n200\n http://localhost:8080/api/customerviews\n\n\n\n\n\nYou must see something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfo\n\n\nNote how the service ip address changes depending on where you call it. To test the service, you can use \nlocalhost\n but since hystrix is running within a container you must provide the host ip.\n\n\nIf the service were deployed as a swarm service, you can access it with a standardized DNS name corresponding to the service name + its version (removing all special characters).\n\n\nFor example, if you deploy the service with \nvulcain run service-facade:1.0\n, you can monitor it with the address \nhttp://servicefacade10:8080/hystrix.stream\n.\n\n\n\n\nFailure compensation\n\u00b6\n\n\nCalling microservice over http is not a long quiet stream, many errors can occur and you must be prepared for this.\nFor this situation, \nvulcain\n uses an hystrix implementation of command. You can configure the command behavior with annotation. For example, the following command has a 1500ms timeout protecting from long requests.\n\n\n@Command\n({\n \nexecutionTimeoutInMilliseconds\n:\n \n1500\n \n})\n\n\nexport\n \nclass\n \nCustomersServiceGetAllCustomerCommand\n \nextends\n \nAbstractServiceCommand\n \n{\n\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the microservice philosophy : Service can failed but quickly.\n\n\nFor most scenarios, if the request failed it's better to send a default response than an error message. This is the role of the compensation (fallBack) method.\n\n\nTry a request failure by removing the backend service with \ndocker service rm customersservice10\n and by requesting again the facade service. Due to the default 1500ms timeout, errors will occur quickly.\nYou can see it in hystrix dashboard.\n\n\n\n\nBefore adding a compensation, we need to understand how the service proxy class works. This class provides a method for each endpoints (handlers) of the target service. Every time a call is made to an endpoint, a (hystrix) command is created by the proxy to encapsulate this call. By default, all calls of the same proxy use the same command named \n<service name>Command\n.\n\n\nIf you need to customize a call, you need to customize a command but only for this specific call. To do that, the proxy class will check for every call if a specific command exists for this call otherwise it will use the default command. A specific command is identified by a name like \n<service name><method name>Command\n.\n\n\nSince we will customize a call to \ngetAllCustomer\n of the proxy class named \nCustomersService\n we need to create a new command named \nCustomersServiceGetAllCustomer\n (Async is always removed for naming).\n\n\nTo add compensation we need to provide a \nfallback\n method returning the default value.\n\n\nYou can now create a new file in src/api/ containing the new command.\n\n\nimport\n \n{\n \nServiceDependency\n,\n \nCommand\n,\n \nAbstractServiceCommand\n,\n \nIHasFallbackCommand\n \n}\n \nfrom\n \n'\nvulcain\n-\ncorejs\n'\n;\n\n\nimport\n \n{\n \nCustomer\n \n}\n \nfrom\n \n'\n./\ncustomersService10\n'\n;\n\n\n\n@Command\n({\n \nexecutionTimeoutInMilliseconds\n:\n \n1500\n \n})\n\n\n@ServiceDependency\n(\n'\ncustomers\n-\nservice\n'\n,\n \n'\n1.0\n'\n,\n \n'\nhttp\n:\n//localhost:30000/api/_servicedescription')\n\n\nexport\n \nclass\n \nCustomersServiceGetAllCustomerCommand\n \nextends\n \nAbstractServiceCommand\n\n    \nimplements\n \nIHasFallbackCommand\n<\nCustomer\n[]>\n \n{\n\n    \nasync\n \nfallback\n():\n \nPromise\n<\nCustomer\n[]>\n \n{\n\n        \nreturn\n \n[{\n\n            \nfirstName\n:\n \n\"John\"\n,\n \nlastName\n:\n \n\"Lennon\"\n\n        \n}];\n\n    \n}\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnnotations are copied from the default generated command. You can see how to set timeout delay and how to define informations used for service description.\n\n\nFallback method is called on every error during the request including timeout.\n\n\nNow if you request the facade service, the compensation response will be returned.",

To visualize metrics, we need to start hystrix dashboard with the following command:  docker service create --network net-vulcain -p  9999 :9002 --name hystrix-dashboard mlabouardy/hystrix-dashboard:latest  Then open the dashboard on  http://localhost:9999/hyxtrix , set the service endpoint with  http://<host ip>:8080/hystrix.stream  and click on  Monitor Stream .  You can test monitoring by calling many requests.\nFor example with :  ab -n  200  http://localhost:8080/api/customerviews  You must see something like this:    Info  Note how the service ip address changes depending on where you call it. To test the service, you can use  localhost  but since hystrix is running within a container you must provide the host ip.  If the service were deployed as a swarm service, you can access it with a standardized DNS name corresponding to the service name + its version (removing all special characters).  For example, if you deploy the service with  vulcain run service-facade:1.0 , you can monitor it with the address  http://servicefacade10:8080/hystrix.stream .",

            "text": "Calling microservice over http is not a long quiet stream, many errors can occur and you must be prepared for this.\nFor this situation,  vulcain  uses an hystrix implementation of command. You can configure the command behavior with annotation. For example, the following command has a 1500ms timeout protecting from long requests.  @Command ({   executionTimeoutInMilliseconds :   1500   })  export   class   CustomersServiceGetAllCustomerCommand   extends   AbstractServiceCommand   {  }   This is the microservice philosophy : Service can failed but quickly.  For most scenarios, if the request failed it's better to send a default response than an error message. This is the role of the compensation (fallBack) method.  Try a request failure by removing the backend service with  docker service rm customersservice10  and by requesting again the facade service. Due to the default 1500ms timeout, errors will occur quickly.\nYou can see it in hystrix dashboard.   Before adding a compensation, we need to understand how the service proxy class works. This class provides a method for each endpoints (handlers) of the target service. Every time a call is made to an endpoint, a (hystrix) command is created by the proxy to encapsulate this call. By default, all calls of the same proxy use the same command named  <service name>Command .  If you need to customize a call, you need to customize a command but only for this specific call. To do that, the proxy class will check for every call if a specific command exists for this call otherwise it will use the default command. A specific command is identified by a name like  <service name><method name>Command .  Since we will customize a call to  getAllCustomer  of the proxy class named  CustomersService  we need to create a new command named  CustomersServiceGetAllCustomer  (Async is always removed for naming).  To add compensation we need to provide a  fallback  method returning the default value.  You can now create a new file in src/api/ containing the new command.  import   {   ServiceDependency ,   Command ,   AbstractServiceCommand ,   IHasFallbackCommand   }   from   ' vulcain - corejs ' ;  import   {   Customer   }   from   ' ./ customersService10 ' ;  @Command ({   executionTimeoutInMilliseconds :   1500   })  @ServiceDependency ( ' customers - service ' ,   ' 1.0 ' ,   ' http : //localhost:30000/api/_servicedescription')  export   class   CustomersServiceGetAllCustomerCommand   extends   AbstractServiceCommand \n     implements   IHasFallbackCommand < Customer []>   { \n     async   fallback ():   Promise < Customer []>   { \n         return   [{ \n             firstName :   \"John\" ,   lastName :   \"Lennon\" \n         }]; \n     }  }   Annotations are copied from the default generated command. You can see how to set timeout delay and how to define informations used for service description.  Fallback method is called on every error during the request including timeout.  Now if you request the facade service, the compensation response will be returned.",
